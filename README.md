# Aptos Seoul Hackathon 

## Coin Object 
Currently, Aptos has account-based structure.
This Project converts account-based structure to object-based structure, which makes it more easy to access global storage with full security. 
You can check the move module code here : [CoinObject](https://github.com/styu12/aptos-coin-object/tree/main/aptos-move/move-examples/coin_objects)
